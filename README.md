 Iâ€™m currently embarking on my journey as a software developer!  
 Like many others can relate, I didn't know what I wanted to pursue professionally.  
 I hopped around from field to field until I discovered the field of software developing and what it truly meant to become a software engineer.
 Now, I want to learn more about programming so that I can work towards my goal of becoming the best programmer that I can be 
 and to provide solutions to real-world challenges.
